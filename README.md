# Loan-Approval-Classification
Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project!
Markup * Developed a machine learning models that assesses the likelihood of an individual's loan approval. 
* The model on a diverse dataset containing information about various individuals with different financial statuses and their historical loan personal information,
* Enabled to discern patterns that influence loan approval decisions.
# Data
The loan approval dataset comprises financial records and related data utilized to assess the qualification of individuals or entities for securing loans from a lending institution. This dataset encompasses diverse variables like credit scores, income, employment standing, loan duration, loan amount, asset valuation, and loan approval status.
# Results
The performance of algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost demonstrates notable similarity in outcomes, while MLP and K-Nearest Neighbor exhibit subpar performance on this specific dataset. This highlights the critical significance of selecting an appropriate model for accurate predictions. Notably, Random Forest (99.69%) and XGBoost (99.69 %) exhibit slightly improved performance, achieving the highest F1 score and Accuracy score among the models considered.
